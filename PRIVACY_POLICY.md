**Last updated:** November 6, 2025

## Introduction

KORA ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data Storage

**KORA operates on a local-only data storage model.** This means:

- **All data is stored locally** on your device only
- **No data is transmitted** to any external servers
- **No cloud services** are used to store your information
- **No accounts or registration** are required to use the app
- **We do not collect, access, or share** any of your personal information

### Types of Data Stored Locally

The following data is stored only on your device:

### Data You Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Export:** You can export your family tree data at any time through the app
- **Import:** You can import previously exported data
- **Delete:** You can delete all data at any time through the app settings
- **No recovery:** Once deleted, data cannot be recovered as we do not store backups

## Third-Party Services

## Children's Privacy

KORA does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13, as all data is stored locally on the device.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your data security depends on your device's security settings
- We recommend:
  - Using device encryption
  - Setting up device lock (PIN, password, biometric)
  - Regularly backing up your data using the export function
  - Keeping your device's operating system up to date

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Data Portability

You can export your data at any time in a standard ZIP format containing:
- JSON file with your family tree structure
- All photos associated with family members

This exported data can be:
- Imported back into KORA
- Transferred to another device
- Stored as a backup

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store any of your data on our servers, we cannot:
- Access your data
- Recover deleted data
- Transfer data between devices (you must use the export/import function)

You have complete control and ownership of your data at all times.
